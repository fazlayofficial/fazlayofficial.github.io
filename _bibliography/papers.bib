  abstract={Preeclampsia prediction is a critical aspect of maternal health which enables early diagnosis and intervention for better maternal and fetal outcomes. However, preeclampsia prediction remains a challenging task due to diverse patient demographics, varying clinical practices, and limited resources. Traditional diagnostic methods often rely on clinical measurements like blood pressure and proteinuria, which can be expensive and time-consuming. This study proposes TabM, a parameter-efficient and interpretable deep learning-based model uniquely tailored for real-time preeclampsia prediction in low-resource settings. The model was trained on datasets from both online and local hospital sources which include features such as maternal age, blood pressure levels and protein-to-creatinine ratios. Despite one dataset being small, the model incorporates domain adaptation strategies and external testing to enhance generalizability. Even in low-resource environments, TabM operates effectively using its ensemble learning mechanism and compact architecture, making it suitable for edge deployment. TabM outperformed traditional machine learning models including-XGBoost, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, achieving an AUC of 0.975. Furthermore, SHAP-based error analysis and confusion matrix breakdowns ensure transparency decision-making in clinical environments. This study highlights the potential of TabM to enhance preeclampsia prediction, making it an ideal solution for real-time clinical application in resource-constraints and diverse-healthcare environments.},

  abstract={Surface electromyography (sEMG) provides a non-invasive and effective way for hand gestures recognition. It plays a crucial role in areas such as prosthetics, human-computer interaction (HCI), and rehabilitation systems. In this study, a hybrid deep learning approach was proposed that combines multi-scale one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D CNNs), bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) layers and an attention mechanism. The hybrid approach is a lightweight and scalable system. It performs efficiently on time-series classification of sEMG signals. The study also focuses on collecting a novel dataset which was recorded from 26 individuals of different age and gender group. The basic five hand gestures samples were collected by using a user-friendly and customized application. The proposed model achieves an impressive test accuracy of 97% while maintaining a compact of 616 K parameters. This lightweight model becomes more suitable for real-time deployment on low-power edge devices. The study further explored cross-data evaluation using the publicly available Ninapro dataset DB1 for model’s robustness and generalizability. By using a hybrid feature extraction technique with deep neural modeling, the proposed method improves both interpretability and performance which offers a practical solution for real-time applications. This study contributes a scalable data collection framework, a novel benchmark dataset and a hybrid model advancing in sEMGbased gesture recognition.},

  abstract={Preeclampsia is a serious pregnancy complication characterized by hypertension and proteinuria that can result in severe maternal and fetal morbidity. Early prediction and timely intervention are essential to improve outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of various machine learning models in predicting preeclampsia, focusing on their ability to minimize false negatives and enhance clinical decision-making. A publicly available dataset comprising patient records was used for model evaluation. Several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression (LR),Passive Aggressive Classifier (PAC), Extra Trees Classifier (ETC), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and CatBoost, were implemented. Performance metrics, such as precision, recall, F1-score, sensitivity, and specificity, were calculated. Among the models tested, CatBoost outperformed the others, achieving the highest AUC of 0.9992 and an F1-score of 0.9812, demonstrating its strong predictive capability. SVM, LR, ETC, and PAC also showed competitive performance, while Random Forest exhibited the weakest classification ability. These findings highlight the potential of machine learning models, particularly CatBoost, in predicting preeclampsia conditions. The integration of such models into clinical practice could improve early prediction and intervention, ultimately enhancing maternal and fetal health outcomes. Future research should focus on validating these models with diverse datasets and integrating them into clinical decision support systems to further optimize their applicability in real-world settings.},
