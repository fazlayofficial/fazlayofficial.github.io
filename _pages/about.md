I am an Electrical and Electronic Engineering graduate with a strong foundation in **Embedded Machine Learning (TinyML)** and **Biomedical Signal Processing**. I am currently leading the **Tiny Neurons Research Group**, where I bridge the gap between Deep Learning theory and resource-constrained hardware implementation.

My research focus lies in:
*   Designing **resource-constrained microsystems** for healthcare monitoring.
*   Optimizing **Edge AI algorithms** for Cortex-M architectures.
*   Developing energy-efficient **AI-IoT sensing networks**.

Previously, I worked as an Application Engineer at **ANTT Robotics Ltd** (Industrial Automation R&D), where I led firmware development for autonomous mobile robots and resolved critical hardware-software synchronization latencies.

I received my Bachelor of Science from the **University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB)** with a CGPA of **3.59/4.00**, where I completed my thesis on "Detecting Preeclampsia with ML Algorithms".

I am actively seeking **Ph.D. opportunities for Fall 2026** to further my research in developing cost-effective, energy-efficient microsystems for healthcare in low-resource settings.
